dynamic-hosts-loader
====================

Dynamically Load or unload different hosts from a specified folder. It can be either an app or a config file. 


-------------


## Purpose
Instead of having one host or specific hosts hard coded served by a node.js server, how about if you can dynamically 
add or remove the host?  
This module allows you to place the config of a host in a specific folder, then it will look for the app (express.js) and add the 
host from the config to the main application server. If you remove the host config file, then the server will no longer serve that
domain.
